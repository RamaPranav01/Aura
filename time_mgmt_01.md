Effective time management is a crucial aspect of students' academic self-regulation, and when paired with mindfulness, it can significantly impact academic emotions (hope, enjoyment, anger, anxiety, fatigue).

## The Role of Time Management

The absence of planning in students causes **stress from not completing assignments and study materials on time**, which acts as a significant barrier to academic progress.

### Reasons for Poor Time Management:
1.  Lack of necessary skills and strategies.
2.  Laziness or lack of necessary goal and motivation.
3.  A preference to work **under pressure and tight time constraints** ("last minute" or crisis conditions).

### Benefits of Time Management:
* Helps students navigate motivational conflicts between study areas and leisure time.
* Allows effective use of time to complete academic tasks.
* Is a significant component of **stress reduction**.

## The Synergy with Mindfulness

Mindfulness-based training, especially when focused on stress reduction, helps students gain better control and awareness of their emotions.

| Intervention | Key Benefit to Academic Emotions |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Mindfulness** | More effective on the components of **hope, anger, and anxiety**. |
| **Time Management** | More effective on the components of **enjoyment and fatigue**. |

**Conclusion:** Interventions based on mindfulness-based stress reduction and time management can **positively control academic emotions** and improve academic performance quality, leading to better learning and greater academic progress.
