**Source:** Purdue Global

Digital wellness (or digital well-being) is critical for students, especially those in online learning environments. It involves managing your use of technology to lessen the physical and mental risks associated with excessive screen time.

## Steps to Achieve Digital Wellness

### 1. Take Inventory
Take an honest look at your current screen time habits and their effects.

* **Self-Reflection:** How does technology use affect your relationships, work/study, and mood?
* **Withdrawal Symptoms:** Do you experience discomfort or anxiety if you lose your phone or don't have access to it?
* **Mindless Checking:** Do you check your phone when you don't need to (e.g., while interacting with others)?

### 2. Reduce Your Screen Time
If you've pinpointed negative effects, commit to reducing time in those areas.

* **Blockers and Limits:** Use website blockers or turn off smartphone notifications when you need to focus on studying.
* **Set Boundaries:** Commit to staying off social networks or personal browsing during dedicated study or work times.

### 3. Consider the Value of Interaction
Evaluate the purpose of your time online.

* **Positive vs. Negative:** Does this app/network contribute positively to my life (e.g., business connections, fitness tracking) or is it a source of negative feelings (comparison, anger) or wasted time?
* **Email Management:** Unsubscribe from email newsletters that no longer serve you or distract your attention.
* **Journaling:** Keep a journal of how you feel after interacting online for a week to identify consistent negative patterns that require a change in habit.

**Goal:** Digital well-being is about making conscious choices to ensure your technology serves you, rather than the other way around.
