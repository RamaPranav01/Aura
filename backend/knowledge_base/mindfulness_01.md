# Making Time for Mindfulness in Education

**Source:** Harvard Graduate School of Education

Mindfulness education—lessons on techniques to calm the mind and body—can reduce the negative effects of stress and increase students' ability to stay engaged. Mindfulness helps students face behavioral and academic challenges by reducing anxiety and giving them a new way to handle their feelings and emotions.

## The Benefits of Mindfulness

A study with sixth-graders found that participation in an eight-week mindfulness program yielded several benefits:

* **Reduced Stress:** Students reported being less stressed out than their non-participating classmates.
* **Improved Self-Control:** Mindfulness helped hone the ability to focus in the moment, expanding students' capacity for self-control.
* **Neurological Changes:** Brain scans showed that the **amygdala** (the part of the brain that controls emotion) responded less to fearful faces, suggesting the students' brains were less reactive to perceived threats.
* **Better Coping Mechanisms:** Mindfulness instruction helped boost students' attention skills and develop coping mechanisms for stress.

## Defining Mindfulness

Mindfulness is generally defined as a mental state that allows individuals to **concentrate on the present moment**, the surrounding environment, and the activities they are engaged in, **without being distracted by past or future events**. It involves accepting things as they are, without intention and with **non-judgmental awareness**.

## Recommendations for Practice

Mindfulness is a valuable tool for mental health and happiness:

* **Consistency:** Build consistency and school-wide buy-in for practicing mindfulness (e.g., guided meditations).
* **Teacher Support:** Provide teachers with dedicated time and support to engage in mindfulness practice themselves.
* **Self-Pacing:** Encourage students' awareness of their own emotions by allowing and encouraging them to identify times when they can use and practice mindfulness as a tool to regulate emotions.
