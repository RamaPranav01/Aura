# Digital Wellbeing 101: Taking Control of Your Life Online

In a world that feels constantly "on," students navigating life on and offline are more likely to experience fatigue, anxiety, stress, and depression. Digital wellness involves mindful use of technology to ensure it enhances, rather than detracts from, academic and personal success.

## Social Media and Mental Health

Research shows a complex link between social media use and mood disorders. Increased Facebook use has been associated with higher levels of loneliness. Students often compare themselves to peers within minutes of waking up, setting the stage for negative self-perception.

### How to Be More Mindful with Social Media:

1.  **Know Your Intentions:** Before you post or scroll, ask: *Am I looking for appreciation, validation, or inclusion?* If so, is there a more constructive way to meet that need?
2.  **Limit Time:** People who spend more than **two hours per day** on social media often report significantly lower self-esteem. Set firm limits.
3.  **Be Curious About Your Mind:** As you scroll, notice the stories your mind makes up (e.g., *I'm not good enough*). Ask yourself if it's **helpful** to believe that story.
4.  **Comparison Check:** If you are struggling with envy or comparison, remember that social media often presents a highly **curated** and inaccurate representation of people's lives ("at their best").

## Practical Strategies for Control

* **Turn Off Notifications:** Constant notifications are distracting, stressful, and addictive. Turn off non-essential or work-related notifications when focusing or during personal time.
* **Unplug and Disconnect:** Designate **tech-free times** (e.g., during meals or before bedtime) to focus on personal interactions, relaxation, or non-screen hobbies.
* **Audit Your Apps:** Honestly evaluate how you feel after using certain apps. If an app makes you feel angry, jealous, or deflated, the negative consequences may not be worth the perceived benefits.
