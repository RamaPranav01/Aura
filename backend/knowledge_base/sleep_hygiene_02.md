**Source:** Stanford Student Affairs

Good sleep hygiene is a set of practices necessary to have good quality sleep. Establishing and keeping a routine is the most critical element.

## Key Sleep Hygiene Practices

1.  **Get Regular Sleep:** Go to bed and get up at more or less the same time each day, **even on the weekends or your day off**.
2.  **Avoid Stimulants:** Avoid consuming **caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine**, as these act as stimulants and interfere with falling asleep.
3.  **Mindful Napping:** Avoid naps during the day. If you must nap, try to keep it **less than an hour and before 3 PM**.
4.  **Electronics Curfew:** Do not use electronics **60 minutes prior to bed**. If 60 minutes is too much, try starting with 30 or 10 minutes prior to bed and build up.
5.  **The Right Space:** Make your bed and bedroom quiet, dark, and comfortable for sleeping.
6.  **Keep the Bed for Sleeping:** Do not use your bed for anything other than sleeping and sex.
7.  **Develop Bedtime Rituals:** Try relaxing stretches, breathing exercises, or a warm shower 15 minutes before bed.
8.  **Get Up and Try Again:** If you've been in bed for **30 minutes or more** without falling asleep, get out of bed and do something calming and relaxing until you feel sleepy again. Do not stay in bed tossing and turning.
9.  **Avoid Clock-Watching:** Checking the clock during the night can wake you up and reinforce negative thoughts about not being able to sleep.
10. **Avoid Catastrophic Thinking:** If you don't get the recommended amount of sleep, do not stress over it. Keep trying new things to help you get to bed earlier the next night.
