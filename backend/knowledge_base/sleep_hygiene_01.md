**Source:** Cornell Health

Many college students get far too little sleep. However, with so much to balance (academics, social life, work), aiming for **8–9 hours of sleep** as often as possible is crucial for optimal performance and health.

## Establishing Good Sleep Hygiene

Good sleep hygiene involves setting up habits and an environment conducive to restful sleep.

### Environment and Routine
* **Regular Schedule:** Set a regular bedtime and rising time, even on weekends, to regulate your internal body clock.
* **Create a Sanctuary:** Your sleeping space should be **dark, quiet, comfortable, and cool**. Use blackout curtains, a fan, or earplugs if necessary.
* **Bed for Sleep Only:** Save time in bed for sleep and sex only—**not studying, eating, or worrying.**
* **Wind Down Routine:** Establish a consistent "relax and wind down" routine (e.g., warm shower, drawing, journaling, quiet music).

### Consumption and Activity
* **Restrict Stimulants:** Avoid caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, and stimulant drugs (prescription and non-prescription) that can affect sleep, especially in the hours before bed.
* **Mindful Eating:** Avoid having a heavy meal 2–3 hours before bedtime.
* **Exercise:** Exercise regularly, but **not right before bedtime**.
* **Naps:** A short nap (20–30 minutes) in the afternoon can be helpful, but long naps can disrupt nighttime sleep.

### Cognitive Management
* **Avoid Screen Time:** Avoid **screen time** (phones, tablets, computers) 30–60 minutes before bed. Blue light suppresses the production of melatonin, the sleep hormone.
* **Don't Dwell on Worries:** If worries and frustrations keep you awake, write them down in a notebook with action statements if needed, and then put the notebook away while you sleep.
* **Meditation:** Learn to meditate to relax and quiet your mind.

**Motivation:** Notice the difference in how you feel after a full night's sleep. It will motivate you to make it a regular habit.
