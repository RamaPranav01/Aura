# Tips for Managing Social Anxiety

**Source:** The Jed Foundation

Social anxiety is characterized by intense fear and anxiety in social situations, often driven by the belief that others are watching and judging every move. People with social anxiety tend to be overly critical of themselves.

## Challenging Negative Thoughts (Cognitive Restructuring)

Social anxiety is often rooted in irrational, fearful thoughts. Challenge them by asking:

* **How realistic is my fear?** What evidence supports this negative belief?
* **What is the worst that can happen?** And how bad is that *really*?
* **What would I tell a friend** if they were feeling this same fear? (You would likely be kind and supportiveâ€”extend that kindness to yourself.)
* **Keep Perspective:** Remind yourself that people pay far less attention to others' lives than we think. If you make a mistake, most people are unlikely to notice or care deeply.

## Mindfulness and Breathing

* **Stay Present:** When anxiety signs appear, practice mindfulness to bring your attention away from projected future worries. Focus on your five senses.
* **Non-Judgmental Awareness:** Experience negative emotions without judging them or immediately acting on them (e.g., fleeing the situation).
* **Deep Breathing:** Slow, deep breaths (filling the belly and chest) can counteract the quick, shallow breathing common in anxiety, which often makes symptoms worse.

## Gradual Social Participation (Exposure)

* **Start Small:** Begin with easier situations, like hanging out with a small, supportive group, and try different experiences as you get more comfortable.
* **Focus Outward:** Try connecting with the people in the social situation instead of focusing entirely on your own behavior and performance.
* **Seek Support:** If you are struggling, reach out to a trusted friend or professional mental health care provider.

**Note on Support:** If you are supporting a friend with social anxiety, avoid dismissive language like, "Just loosen up!" or "You're being too quiet." Instead, offer words of affirmation and encouragement.
