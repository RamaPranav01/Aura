# A Student's Perspective on Test Anxiety

**Source:** UCLA School Mental Health Project

Test anxiety is a common type of performance anxiety characterized by **psychological distress**, academic failure, and insecurity about succeeding academically. Pressures to do well are increasing, as tests often determine grades, college acceptances, and future employment.

## Symptoms and Prevalence

* **Physical Reactions:** Stomach aches, headaches, increased heart rate/palpitations, shaking, sweating, and panic attacks.
* **Cognitive Impact:** An inability to concentrate and difficulty recalling studied material.
* **Prevalence:** Estimates suggest that **40-60% of students** are negatively affected by significant test anxiety that interferes with their ability to perform up to their capability.

## Interventions and Recommendations

Research indicates that students can significantly benefit from targeted interventions:

### 1. Psychological Treatments
Techniques that have demonstrated promising results:
* **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Used to challenge and reframe negative thought patterns.
* **Biofeedback:** Learning to control physiological processes like heart rate.
* **Behavior Therapy** and **Mixed Approaches**.

### 2. Organizational Skills for Test-Taking
Instructors and students should focus on:
* Learning how to approach different test formats (multiple choice, essay).
* Pacing test-taking given time limits.
* Avoiding excessive time on any one item.

### 3. Emotional Regulation
* **Identify Triggers:** School psychologists and counselors can help students identify sources of anxiety and take steps to counter their negative thinking and comparison with others.
* **Relaxation Techniques:** Teach and encourage the use of relaxation techniques to manage physical symptoms in the moment.

### 4. Broadening the Definition of Success
A key recommendation is to place **less emphasis on test performance** and more weight on other products of learning, which can help reduce the overall stress students feel in the academic setting.
