# Exam Stress: Causes and Cognitive Strategies

**Source:** Concordia University

Exam stress is a common form of anxiety that affects academic performance. It often stems from a combination of skill gaps, lifestyle issues, and psychological factors. The most effective reduction combines skill-focused approaches with cognitive strategies.

## Causes of Exam Stress

1.  **Skill Issues:** Poor study skills, ineffective note-taking, and weak exam-taking strategies.
2.  **Lifestyle Issues:** Inadequate sleep, poor nutrition, stimulant use (caffeine/energy drinks), and insufficient exercise.
3.  **Time Management Issues:** Not scheduling available time and not prioritizing commitments effectively.
4.  **Psychological Factors:**
    * Feeling little or no control over the situation.
    * **Negative Thinking and Self-Criticism:** E.g., "I am not smart enough," or "I will fail this exam."
    * **Irrational Demands:** E.g., "I have to get an A or I am worthless."
    * **Catastrophic Predictions:** E.g., "I'll fail no matter what I do."

## Strategies to Reduce Exam Stress

### 1. Improve Study & Exam-Taking Skills

* **Preparation is Key:** Effective preparation goes beyond simply rereading material. Focus on active recall and using practice tests.

### 2. Change Negative Thinking Patterns (Cognitive Restructuring)

* **Identify Negative Thoughts:** Pay close attention to what you tell yourself before and during an exam ("I don't understand this stuff," "I'm sure to fail").
* **Stop and Restructure:** When you hear a negative thought, actively take a new, positive perspective. Challenge the thought: *What evidence do I have that this is true? What is a more helpful way to look at this?*
* **Address Lack of Preparation:** If you weren't prepared, ask *why* (e.g., lack of time, didn't understand material) and adjust your future study plan, rather than dwelling on the past failure.

### 3. Learn to Relax (Somatic Strategies)

* **Deep Breathing:** The simplest and most effective technique. Slowly and deeply inhale through your nose for a count of four, **hold for seven**, and **exhale slowly through pursed lips for a count of eight**. Repeat four times.
* **Body Relaxation:** Other techniques include progressive muscle relaxation, yoga, and meditation.
* **Healthy Behaviors:** Engaging in regular physical activity and eating healthfully helps buffer against the physical effects of stress.

### 4. Talk Things Out

* If you can't identify the root of your stress, speaking with a mental health professional can provide a clear plan to explore the factors related to your exam stress and overcome them.
