# How to Overcome Social Anxiety: Effective Exercises

**Source:** Positive Psychology

Social anxiety involves an intense fear of being judged or evaluated negatively in social situations, often leading to avoidance behaviors. Techniques based on cognitive-behavioral principles, exposure, and mindfulness can significantly reduce symptoms and improve social confidence.

## Grounding Techniques for In-the-Moment Anxiety

Grounding techniques help you shift focus from anxious thoughts back to the present moment, actively downregulating the nervous system.

1.  **Breathing Techniques:** Practice deep breathing (e.g., inhale for four, hold for four, exhale slowly over eight seconds). Exhaling longer than inhaling helps slow a racing heart.
2.  **Touch:** Rub your earlobes or elbows, which are areas that cannot hold tension, to soothe the nervous system.
3.  **Counting/5-4-3-2-1:** Focus on counting and observation of surroundings: Find **five** things you can see, **four** things you can feel, **three** things you can hear, **two** things you can smell, and **one** thing you can taste. Be as specific as possible.

## Longer-Term Coping Mechanisms

* **Mindfulness Practice:** Enhances the ability to **sit with discomfort** without getting swept away by anxious feelings.
* **Physical Exercise:** Acts as a protective buffer against psychological distress and boosts positive emotions.
* **Exposure Therapy (Facing Your Fears):** Gradually exposing yourself to feared social situations. Start small (e.g., initiating conversation with a friend) and work your way up.
* **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Used to challenge negative thoughts and develop positive coping skills.

**Public Speaking Tip:** Before giving a speech, do star jumps or jumping jacks to **burn off nervous energy**. During the speech, use gestures and move around to consume more of that energy.
