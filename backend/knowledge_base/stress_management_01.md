# Understanding Test Anxiety & Anxiety Reduction Strategies

**Source:** University of Northern Colorado (UNCO)

Test anxiety involves an intense fear of being judged or evaluated negatively in test situations, often leading to avoidance behaviors and reduced performance. Anxiety can stem from ineffective study skills or from the thoughts, feelings, and physical responses to the test-taking experience itself.

## Strategies for Managing Test Anxiety

### The Adrenaline Rush: Control and Recovery

Students with high test anxiety often experience rushes of **adrenaline** (a flight/fight response) that can block the brain from thinking clearly.

* **Burn Off Energy:** Engage in physical activity for at least 10 minutes *before* your exam to help your body process the chemical release of adrenaline.
* **Start Simple:** Begin by answering only the questions you feel confident about. This creates positive momentum and allows your brain time to recover from the initial adrenaline shot before tackling more complicated questions.

### Prepare Your Body and Mind

* **Physical Preparation:** Get a **good night's sleep** and eat a proper, nutritious meal. Avoid caffeine and high sugar intake, as these substances naturally raise your state of alertness, which can mimic or exacerbate anxiety symptoms.
* **Avoid Cramming:** Create a test study schedule with allotted times and **stick to it**. Last-minute cramming increases stress.
* **Organize:** Organize all your materials (pencils, note cards, calculator) the night before.
* **Timing:** Get to the exam **on time, not too early**. Arriving too early can allow your anxiety to build.

### In the Test Environment

* **Avoid Negativity:** Avoid speaking with any fellow students who are not prepared or who express negativity just before the exam.
* **Organizational Skills:** Approach different test formats (multiple choice, essay) strategically. Carefully read/listen to all directions. **Pace yourself** and avoid taking too much time on any one item. Skip especially difficult questions until the others are answered.

### Seek Support

* **Get a Sounding Board:** Seek out someone who can help you recognize if your anxiety is getting the best of you. They can help you assess the situation and brainstorm preparation strategies.
* **Talk to Your Instructor:** Share your test anxiety issues with your instructor *before* the exam day. They may be willing to explore accommodations (e.g., taking the test in a separate office, being allowed a break).
