**Source:** Mental Health First Aid (MHFA)

Self-care is a crucial strategy for maintaining a healthy mind and body, especially while balancing the demands of college. It is about making yourself a priority.

## Practical Self-Care Tips

1.  **Set a Routine â€“ and Keep It:** Plan to wake up, eat, study, and exercise around the same times every day. Routines provide structure and stability, reducing stress.
2.  **Prioritize Sleep:** Aim for at least **7 hours** of sleep each night. Sleep deprivation can lead to irritability, inability to focus, and worsened symptoms of depression.
3.  **Exercise Regularly:** Physical activity makes people happier, improves functional capacity, and decreases anxiety and depression. Choose a form of exercise that you **like** so it truly feels like self-care.
4.  **Eat Nutritious Meals & Hydrate:** A balanced diet helps you think clearly and improve your attention span. Since your brain is 73% water, drinking plenty of water is essential for healthy brain functioning.
5.  **Practice Mindfulness, Meditation, and Gratitude:** Meditation can increase self-awareness, improve sleep quality, and increase the ability to manage stress. Practice gratitude by focusing on things you are grateful for, perhaps by keeping a gratitude journal.
6.  **Clean Up:** Cleaning and decluttering your living space helps you gain a **sense of control**, improve your mood, and reduce anxiety levels. Create a chore list to maintain a space that is a sanctuary.
7.  **Set Realistic Goals:** Setting achievable goals helps define priorities and improves self-confidence and motivation. Avoid overcommitting or taking on more than you can handle, as this leads to stress.

**Remember:** Self-care is a continuous process. If you are struggling, reach out for professional mental health support.
