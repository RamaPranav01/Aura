* **Aromatherapy and Fragrance:** Use scents (candles, essential oils) to create a calming environment.
* **Warm Bath** or **Water Therapy** (e.g., spending time by water).
* **Silence:** Schedule time for quiet and stillness.

### 2. Creative & Hobbies
* **Creative Outlets:** Drawing, painting, creative writing, making music, baking, or cooking.
* **Gaming:** Playing video games, board games, or engaging in puzzles.
* **Books & Reading:** Use stories and literature as an escape or a learning tool.
