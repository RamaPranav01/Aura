**Source:** National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)

The NIMH provides expert-reviewed information on mental disorders, including depression, and resources to promote emotional well-being and foster a supportive learning environment.

## Understanding Depression

Depression is a common but serious mood disorder. It causes severe symptoms that affect how you feel, think, and handle daily activities, such as sleeping, eating, or working.

## Resources and Key Facts

* **Expert Information:** NIMH offers expert-reviewed facts and statistics on the prevalence, treatment, and costs of mental illness.
* **The Teen Brain:** Understanding the developing adolescent brain is key to understanding mental health challenges in students. NIMH provides resources on **The Teen Brain: 7 Things to Know**.
* **Mental Health Education:** Materials are available to help students understand and cope with big feelings like stress, frustration, and sadness.

## Getting Help

If you or someone you know has a mental illness, resources are available:

* **Local Support:** Consult with your school counselor or health services for immediate, local support options.
* **Crisis Lines:** Use national resources for immediate help. (Note: The NIMH provides information linking to these lines, such as the *Suicide & Crisis Lifeline: Dial 988* in the US).

**Key Takeaway:** Mental illnesses are real, common, and treatable. Seeking help is a sign of strength and is the first step toward recovery and improved academic success.
